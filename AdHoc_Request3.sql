# Retrieves revenue data for each campaign from the fact_events table.
# Joins fact_events with dim_campaigns using campaign_id to get campaign names.
# Calculates revenue before campaign by multiplying base_price with quantity_sold(before_promo), then dividing by 1,000,000 to express it in millions.
# Calculates revenue after campaign by applying logic based on the promo_type:
    # -'BOGOF': Half price per item, sold in double quantity.
    # -'25% OFF': 25% discount on base price.
    # -'50% OFF': 50% discount on base price.
    # -'33% OFF': 33% discount on base price.
    # -'500 Cashback': Flat â‚¹500 discount on base price.
# Rounds both revenue values to 2 decimal places.
# Groups the results by campaign_name to show revenue impact per campaign.
